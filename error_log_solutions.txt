Google APIs Error Log Solutions

If receiving - ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT - error.
You need to make sure you look at the code that is initially creating the token.

So I fixed this by changing the way I called the Google scopes. 

DriveScopes.DRIVE is different than DriveScopes.DRIVE_METADATA_READONLY
